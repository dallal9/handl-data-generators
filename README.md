# J. Handl: data generators

Syntetic data generators for creating datasets with Gaussian distribution. The code was taken from [official website](http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/mbs/Julia.Handl/generators.html) and slightly modified for modern compilers.

## Usage

$ make
$ ./mult_generator
```
